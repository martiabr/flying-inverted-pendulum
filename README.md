# flying-inverted-pendulum
Matlab simulation of a flying inverted pendulum. The implementation is based on M. Hehn and R. Dâ€™Andrea "A Flying Inverted Pendulum". The simulation consists of a script for initializing the simulation and finding the LQR gains, a Simulink simulation of the quadrotor + pendulum dynamics and a script for animating and plotting the simulation results.
